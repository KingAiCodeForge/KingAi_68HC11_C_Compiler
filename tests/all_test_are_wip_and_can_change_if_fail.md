# Tests — Work in Progress

All test scripts are **work in progress** and have **not been validated on
physical hardware** at runtime. They exist to test the software toolchain
(compiler, assembler, patcher, emulator).

- More test variants will be added as the compiler gains new features.
- Existing tests may change if bugs are found or code generation is updated.
