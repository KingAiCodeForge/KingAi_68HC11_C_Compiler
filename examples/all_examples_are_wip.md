# Examples — Work in Progress

All example programs in this folder are **work in progress** and have **not been validated on physical hardware** at runtime.

These exist to:
- Test the software toolchain (compiler → assembler → binary pipeline)
- Demonstrate supported C language features
- Provide starting points for real ECU patches

More examples will be added over time. Existing ones may change as the compiler evolves — particularly if codegen bugs are found or new features (arrays, structs) are implemented.
