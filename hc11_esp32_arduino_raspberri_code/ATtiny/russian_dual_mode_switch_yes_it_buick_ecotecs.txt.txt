hc11_esp32_arduino_raspberri_code\ATtiny\Dualmode Switch
is a basicly what its named after what it does. could be edited for bigger chips.
similar to moates g6 when the map switcher is together and plugged in and a stacked bin.
a good reference. i like the indicator light, very russian.
unsure where this is from so i dont know who to credit.
